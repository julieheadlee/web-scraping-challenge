# web-scraping-challenge

The purpose of this project is to consolidate several sources of information about Mars missions and facts and pictures related to the planet.  After developing the necesssary scraping code, the data was saved to a dictionary, and then into a Mongo database.  From there, it was used to create a simple bootstrap-based website.
